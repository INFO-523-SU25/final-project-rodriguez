The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labeled as fraudulent (Class = 1), making it highly imbalanced.\n\nAlthough the dataset includes labeled anomalies, I am approaching this as an unsupervised anomaly detection task, simulating a real-world scenario where fraudulent examples are not labeled during model training. Labels are withheld during training and used only for model evaluation.\n\n## Questions\n\n1.  How well do unsupervised ensemble-based models detect fraudulent transactions when labels are withheld during training?\n2.  How do distance-based and statistical approaches to outlier detection compare to ensemble-based methods in identifying rare but meaningful anomalies?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   Data Preprocessing (August 6–7)\n\n    -   Load and clean the dataset; scale relevant features.\n\n-   Modeling: Unsupervised Learning (August 8–10)\n\n    -   Implement anomaly detection methods.\n\n-   Evaluation (August 11–13)\n\n    -   Assess model performance.\n\n-   Visualization (August 13–16)\n\n    -   Create performance plots and visual summaries of detected anomalies.\n\n-   Presentation Prep (August 17–19)\n\n    -   Finalize presentation materials and write-up of results.\n\n",
